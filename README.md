* How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

All untrusted data sources must be validated to ensure the implementation of secure coding practices. A system that requires different privileges at different times can be divided into intercommunicating subsystems, each with its own privileges. Implementation, configuration, and the use of complex designs can lead to errors. Complexity increases the amount of effort needed to achieve appropriate assurance. If different privileges are needed at other times, your system should be divided into distinct intercommunicating subsystems. Command shells, relational databases, and commercial off-the-shelf components should be sanitized when passing data. The problem isn't necessarily input validation because the complex subsystem you interact with needs to understand the context. Since the calling process understands the context, it is responsible for sanitizing the data. By combining secure programming techniques with secure runtime environments, the probability of exploiting vulnerabilities in code at deployment is reduced. In addition to a secure coding standard, effective quality assurance programs should include fuzz testing, penetration testing, and source code audits.

* How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Clients must articulate their requirements early on if they are to provide the most effective product. Otherwise, fixing requirements errors will drain your development budget and threaten your business. The traditional method of gathering user requirements is to write a set of textual requirements to deliver the right product. 

You need formal specifications, but textual requirements seldom communicate user needs effectively. Discovering, investigating, and making decisions about user needs is both an art and a science. Through analysis models -- representations of user requirements -- successful projects engage users early and explore and reach closure on their requirements.

* How do I approach designing software?

A well-structured design follows the rules for communication among multiple modules, like cohesion and coupling, where cohesion refers to all functionally related components grouped together, and coupling refers to communication between them. Decomposition centers on identifying the primary software function and then elaborating and refining them in a top-down manner based on function-oriented Design. An essential part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is Software Design. It involves problem-solving and planning a software solution.

Design strategies are mainly about organizing design activities. Software designers often consider a list of design issues and tasks to be discussed and addressed on an ad hoc basis. In addition to solving these problems, designers can use design strategies. 

Software engineers use various strategies to define their responsibilities and assist them with software design. These strategies allow one to design a software development plan that meets all client demands, requirements, and requests. Software engineers use some of these strategies to create authentic and bug-free software products. Structured Design has the biggest advantage of helping you better understand how the problem is being solved, so the designer can focus on the problem more accurately. 

Cohesion and coupling are the rules for communicating among multiple modules in a well-structured design. Cohesion is grouping all functionally related elements, and coupling is communication between different modules. Structured Design employs division and conquers to accomplish major system tasks in function-oriented Design.
Instead of concentrating on functions, software solutions focus on the engaged entities.
